## Project Overview

This is a LlamaIndex project that implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application. It uses a Next.js frontend and a Node.js backend with LlamaIndexTS. The application is designed to answer questions about documents stored in the `data` directory. The core of the application is an agentic workflow that uses an OpenAI model (`gpt-4o-mini` by default) to interact with a vector index of the documents.

The project is structured as follows:

- **`src`**: Contains the main source code for the application.
  - **`app`**: Contains the core application logic.
    - **`settings.ts`**: Configures the LLM and embedding models.
    - **`workflow.ts`**: Defines the agentic RAG workflow.
    - **`data.ts`**: Manages the data and index.
  - **`generate.ts`**: A script to generate the vector store from the documents in the `data` directory.
  - **`index.ts`**: The main entry point for the server.
- **`data`**: Contains the documents that the RAG application will use to answer questions.
- **`storage`**: Stores the vector index generated by `src/generate.ts`.
- **`pages`**: Contains the Next.js pages for the chat UI.
- **`public`**: Contains static assets for the Next.js application.
- **`components`**: Contains React components for the UI.
- **`layout`**: Contains the layout for the UI.

## Building and Running

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your OpenAI API key:
    ```
    OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
    ```
    You can also configure the `MODEL`, `EMBEDDING_MODEL`, `LLM_MAX_TOKENS`, and `EMBEDDING_DIM` environment variables to customize the models used by the application.

3.  **Generate the vector store:**
    ```bash
    npm run generate
    ```
    This will create a `storage` directory containing the vector index of the documents in the `data` directory.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Next.js development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Development Conventions

- **Frameworks:** The project uses Next.js for the frontend and LlamaIndexTS for the backend.
- **Linting and Formatting:** The project uses the default Next.js ESLint and Prettier configuration.
- **Testing:** There are no tests in the project.
- **Dependencies:** The project uses `npm` to manage dependencies.
- **Code Style:** The code follows standard TypeScript and React conventions.
